            <h3>The Four Emperors</h3>
            <p>The Four Emperors are the four most notorious and powerful pirate captains in the world. They are not
                typically allies, nor are they strictly enemies of one another. Rather, the four prefer to remain
                autonomous
                under most circumstances. These four individually reside within the second half of the Grand Line (known
                as
                the "New World"), exerting impressive influence and control over dozens of other pirate crews and
                self-governing islands.</p>
